The spellcaster gains Retaliatory Strike.
Onery lasts for one round.
(If a model with Retaliatory Strike is hit by an enemy melee attack during your opponent's turn, after that attack is resolved the model with Retaliatory Strike can immediately make one basic melee attack against the attacking model.
A model with Retaliatory Strike can make only one Retaliatory Strike per turn.)
