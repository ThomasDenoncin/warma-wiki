When a friendly Faction model in the spellcaster's control range destroys one or more enemy models with a melee or ranged attack during its activation, immediately after the attack is resolved one warbeast in the spellcaster's battlegroup that is in its control range can advance up to 3". A warbeast can advance as a result of Warpath only once per turn.
